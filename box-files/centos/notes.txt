install nethogs (shows all processes using bandwidth)
install tcptrack (watches each connection)
find way to watch for changes in filesystem (can just show changes, we can use that to determine if we're hacked)
automate snort install and setup (that's gonna suck)
look into Linux containers for services
limit amount of processes
kick user after x attempts to log in
